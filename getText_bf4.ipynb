      "Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "     We are engaged in one principal business segment — material handling equipment and systems.\n",
      "We operate in two primary geographic locations — North and South America (the “Americas”) and\n",
      "Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia (“EMEA/Asia”).\n",
      "\n",
      "     Within the material handling equipment and systems segment, we have two main business or\n",
      "product lines (“business lines”), which are our process and size reduction business lines. The\n",
      "process business line is a combination of our former feeder and pneumatic conveying business lines.\n",
      "\n",
      "     In 2005 compared with 2004, customers of our size reduction business line, particularly\n",
      "coal-fired power generation plants, increased their spending on capital equipment. At the same\n",
      "time, sales of our process business line declined, largely due to lower spending by customers in\n",
      "EMEA/Asia.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Management looks at trends in what it believes to be relevant indicators, such as the PMI\n",
      "Index for manufacturing published by the Institute of Supply Management and similar foreign\n",
      "indices, to help it better understand the prospects for capital equipment spending as it may affect\n",
      "our process business line. These indicators remained positive throughout 2005, with fluctuating\n",
      "monthly values. Historically, increases in our feeding equipment sales generally have lagged\n",
      "improvements in these indicators, in some cases by as much as six to twelve months.\n",
      "\n",
      "     We believe, based in part on independent market studies, that we are the global leader in the\n",
      "design, production, marketing and servicing of high-quality industrial feeders for the handling of\n",
      "bulk solids in a wide variety of manufacturing processes. Markets served include the plastics,\n",
      "food, chemical, detergent and pharmaceutical industries. The majority of the revenues and profits\n",
      "of our K-Tron process business line is generated by equipment and systems sales, with a lesser\n",
      "amount attributable to service, parts and repairs. Feeders are sold under the K-Tron Feeders brand\n",
      "name both domestically and in other countries around the world. New product innovation is a major\n",
      "objective of the R&D efforts of this business. In our process business line we have the ability to\n",
      "serve nearly all geographic regions of the world from our two assembly-and-test facilities in\n",
      "Pitman, New Jersey and Niederlenz, Switzerland and our sales and service offices in France,\n",
      "Germany, the United Kingdom, Singapore and China (service only).\n",
      "\n",
      "     Our pneumatic conveying equipment, sold under the K-Tron PCS and K-Tron Colormax brand names,\n",
      "comprises a relatively small portion of the total revenues of our process business line. This\n",
      "equipment is sometimes sold through the K-Tron Process Group in conjunction with feeder equipment\n",
      "as a means of transporting dry material from one part of a plant to the inlet of a feeder, and in\n",
      "other cases the equipment and complete systems are sold in applications that do not necessarily\n",
      "incorporate feeders, primarily in the United Kingdom. Aside from selling into markets common to\n",
      "those for industrial feeders, pneumatic conveying equipment is also sold into the plastics\n",
      "injection molding market. Factors affecting the sale of pneumatic conveying equipment are similar\n",
      "to those which affect feeder equipment but also include factors that may affect the secondary\n",
      "plastics market generally.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Our size reduction business line was added with the purchase of Penn Crusher and Jeffrey on\n",
      "January 2, 2003. In contrast to our process business line, Penn Crusher and Jeffrey sell equipment\n",
      "primarily into the U.S. market, with some sales into foreign countries, particularly China. The\n",
      "main industries served are the electric utility, mining, pulp and paper and wood and forest\n",

      "industries, and a majority of revenues and profits are generated from replacement part\n",
      "sales instead of new equipment. Both Penn Crusher and Jeffrey have developed and currently\n",
      "maintain an extensive digital database of previously sold equipment, including equipment\n",
      "specifications and drawings, that enables them to respond quickly and efficiently to fill\n",
      "customers’ spare parts orders. Significant indicators that management uses to judge prospects for\n",
      "this business line in the U.S. include the level of electricity consumption, the financial health\n",
      "of the electric utility industry and the demand for paper and forest products. With our\n",
      "acquisition of Gundlach in March 2006, our size reduction business line was expanded to include a\n",
      "leading provider of size reduction equipment to the coal mining industry, both in the United States\n",
      "and elsewhere in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "     The following provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and\n",
      "understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The discussion\n",

      "     This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on\n",
      "our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles\n",
      "generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires\n",
      "management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and\n",
      "liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial\n",
      "statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\n",
